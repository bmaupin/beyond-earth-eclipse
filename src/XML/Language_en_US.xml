                <Text>What many don’t realize about Suzanne Fielding’s take-no-prisoner approach to corporate growth is that it is the result of numerous failures and years of hardship. Over the years, she never gave up on the American dream, ascending the ranks of the American Reclamation Corporation even when it meant climbing on the backs of others in order to make her way to the top. Her relentless drive and strategic acumen have made ARC a dominant force on the new planet. As the years have passed, Suzanne's ambitions to keep ARC at the top and herself at the top of ARC have only grown stronger, to the point that little remains of the scrappy intern that she once was.</Text>

                <Text>As one of the most easily recognized personalities on Old Earth, Suzanne Fielding is uniquely familiar with most, if not all of the other Sponsors. What started out as natural relationships has slowly been turned into one of the many building blocks of ARC's formidable intelligence behemoth. As corporations have evolved into governments, what could have been called customer relations have evolved into something else altogether: a vast secretive web of espionage that the ARC uses to keep an eye on both friend and foe. To what purposes, only Fielding may know.</Text>

                <Text>ARC, along with the other sponsors, was simply content to survive the vast journey across space and make planetfall, focusing solely on survival of itself and its citizens. As time has passed, the old itch of manifest destiny has slowly started to creap upon the body of the organisation. Natural growth as the ARC has acclimated to the planet and its ecosystem has started to give way to stronger feelings of expansionism. How much will be enough to satiate the ARC's appetite for more territory and resources? And what will it sacrifice along the way?</Text>

                <Text>Rejinaldo Leonardo Pedro Bolivar de Alencar-Araripe, the leader of Brasilia, came from a long line of military heroes. A common saying among his people is that he was born wearing a uniform. The possibility of Rejinaldo entering into any career other than the military was never even considered in his household, and to even hint at such a thing would have been taboo. This same all-encompassing fixation with the military seeps through every facet of life for Brasilia on this new planet. Children are indoctrinated from a very young age, and education centres on how best to prepare children to either be in the military or help support it. As Brasilia looks across the new planet, they see little else besides a land to be conquered behind the barrel of a gun.</Text>

                <Text>For Rejinaldo de Alencar-Araripe, his humanity is defined in very narrow terms. While other sponsors have embraced unknown alien monstrosities or dangerous robotic augmentations, this is akin to turning one's back on one's own humanity as far as Rejinaldo is concerned. He has little tolerance for such creatures (for he does not even deign to use the term "human" in these cases). From his point of view, there is no possibility of cooperation or collaboration with those willing to give up what it means to be human. Their choice will only lead to extermination alongside anything else that does not qualify as human in his eyes.</Text>

                <Text>While on Earth, Brasilia used its nearly unmatched military might around the world to help those in need and eliminate abuse and oppression. With humanity's very existence hanging in the balance, humanitarian needs trumped old ways of conquest and domination. However, now that Brasilia and the other sponsors have made planetfall on a new alien world, fears for their survival have given way to intolerance of the way of life chosen by much of the population of the new planet. Do they deserve to stand on an equal footing with the great Brasilia while chasing after at best frivolous pursuits such as art, luxury, or filling their stomachs? Not to mention those that have traded their own humanity to embrace ... alienness. They deserve what's coming to them.</Text>

                <Text>What many don’t realize about Suzanne Fielding’s take-no-prisoner approach to corporate growth is that it is the result of numerous failures and years of hardship. Over the years, she never gave up on the American dream, ascending the ranks of the American Reclamation Corporation even when it meant climbing on the backs of others in order to make her way to the top. Her relentless drive and strategic acumen have made ARC a dominant force on the new planet. As the years have passed, Suzanne's ambitions to keep ARC at the top and herself at the top of ARC have only grown stronger, to the point that little remains of the scrappy intern that she once was.</Text>

                <Text>As one of the most easily recognized personalities on Old Earth, Suzanne Fielding is uniquely familiar with most, if not all of the other Sponsors. What started out as natural relationships has slowly been turned into one of the many building blocks of ARC's formidable intelligence behemoth. As corporations have evolved into governments, what could have been called customer relations have evolved into something else altogether: a vast secretive web of espionage that the ARC uses to keep an eye on both friend and foe. To what purposes, only Fielding may know.</Text>

                <Text>ARC, along with the other sponsors, was simply content to survive the vast journey across space and make planetfall, focusing solely on survival of itself and its citizens. As time has passed, the old itch of manifest destiny has slowly started to creap upon the body of the organisation. Natural growth as the ARC has acclimated to the planet and its ecosystem has started to give way to stronger feelings of expansionism. How much will be enough to satiate the ARC's appetite for more territory and resources? And what will it sacrifice along the way?</Text>

                <Text>Rejinaldo Leonardo Pedro Bolivar de Alencar-Araripe, the leader of Brasilia, came from a long line of military heroes. A common saying among his people is that he was born wearing a uniform. The possibility of Rejinaldo entering into any career other than the military was never even considered in his household, and to even hint at such a thing would have been taboo. This same all-encompassing fixation with the military seeps through every facet of life for Brasilia on this new planet. Children are indoctrinated from a very young age, and education centres on how best to prepare children to either be in the military or help support it. As Brasilia looks across the new planet, they see little else besides a land to be conquered behind the barrel of a gun.</Text>

                <Text>For Rejinaldo de Alencar-Araripe, his humanity is defined in very narrow terms. While other sponsors have embraced unknown alien monstrosities or dangerous robotic augmentations, this is akin to turning one's back on one's own humanity as far as Rejinaldo is concerned. He has little tolerance for such creatures (for he does not even deign to use the term "human" in these cases). From his point of view, there is no possibility of cooperation or collaboration with those willing to give up what it means to be human. Their choice will only lead to extermination alongside anything else that does not qualify as human in his eyes.</Text>

With humanity's very existence hanging in the balance, humanitarian needs trumped old ways of conquest and domination. However, now that Brasilia and the other sponsors have made planetfall on a new alien world, fears for their survival have given way to intolerance of the way of life chosen by much of the population of the new planet. Do they deserve to stand on an equal footing with the great Brasilia while chasing after at best frivolous pursuits such as art, luxury, or filling their stomachs? Not to mention those that have traded their own humanity to embrace ... alienness. They deserve what's coming to them.</Text>

The lowest, publicly acknowledged level, Abyssopelagic-0, is home to deep-sea, scientific research, energy production and resource harvesting. Below Abyssopelagic-0 is the Chungsu academy, which exists in extreme pressure, total darkness, and near freezing temperatures. When the earthquake that triggered the Hareubang Tsunami hit the academy, a stress fracture developed on the surface of the outer dome. Moments before the dome’s collapse, Han Jae Moon evacuated his fellow students of the satellite Sky Station facility into multiple deep-sea submarines.

The practice involves a deep-sea diving suit, and little else. Would-be agents are left alone at the bottom of hadopelagic trenches for hours at a time. Bioluminescent flashes are the only visible stimuli, and the muffled sound of the ocean the only accompaniment. These sessions were often preceded by intense physical training, so that exhaustion would threaten to overwhelm the participant. Intense focus was required to stay awake, and alive.</Text>

From there, however, theologians disagree on who, or what, constitutes the ‘First’ and ‘Second’ Mothers. One argument is that Old Earth, (a.k.a. ‘Gaia’ or ‘Terra’) is the First Mother, while the second is the literal mother of every individual. The other theory is that Kavitha refers to a supernatural progenitor as the First Mother, and that the Second Mother is humankind itself.</Text>
