#### Reload mod changes

Unfortunately [the trick from Micro Beyond Earth](https://github.com/bmaupin/micro-beyond-earth/blob/main/docs/development.md) doesn't work to reload the mod without exiting the game. Maybe the mod is too big or contains too many files?

What does work is go into the _DLC_ menu and unload and reload Rising Tide.
