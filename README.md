-->

## To do

- [x] Overwrite all leader tech/wonder audio
- [x] Remove hybrid affinities from all techs; hybrid affinity should be a choice, not an accident
- [ ] Adjust all leader traits to have stronger personalities
- [ ] Find a way to bring text from victory dialogue to the front; it's interesting
- [ ] Add new leader intro text for all leaders to reflect darker theme

## Features

TODO

#### Tech and wonder quotes are now spoken by sponsors

All tech and wonder quotes from sponsors have had their audio overridden so that they're now spoken by the respective sponsor instead of the same narrator that narrates most of the rest of the game in order to add more variety to the spoken dialogue.

#### Tech tree affinities have been reverted to base game values

Rising Tide added affinity values to techs that previously didn't have any (like many branch techs) and also added multiple affinities to many techs. This was possibly to ensure players were more likely to interact with hybrid affinities in the game, but it made acquiring any particular affinity less intentional.

These changes have been reverted in this mod, so that acquiring any particular affinity once again is an intentional choice the player can make rather something they fall into as a result of progressing through the tech web.
