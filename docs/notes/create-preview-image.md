   - p0_bgt45.ttf in the game installation

1. Get or generate an image to use

1. Open the image with GIMP

1. Resize the canvas as needed to make the image square or crop any unwanted content

   1. If needed, use the measuring tool to determine how much of the image to crop

   1. _Image_ > _Canvas Size_

   1. Change the image width/height as needed, making sure they're both the same to keep the image square as per Steam recommendations
