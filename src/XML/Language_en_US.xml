They, in thy sun, budded, and shook their green leaves in the breeze, and shot towards Heaven.” For today, we have budded and now shoot towards Heaven. And though I cannot say whether our next home will have trees such as these, I carry hope that it will be worthy of the beauty I bring with me.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]</Text>

As she ascended the ranks of the American Reclamation Corporation, her struggles changed in nature.

Bioluminescent flashes are the only visible stimuli, and the muffled sound of the ocean the only accompaniment.

                <Text>During her time as a political activist, Lena spent years living abroad and learning from different cultures. Because of her help in resolving the nearly 300 year old Mediterranean debt crisis, she was hailed as a folk-hero from Cyprus City to Olympus Island. To commemorate the victory, Lena used the payment she received in legal fees to work with ARC in restoring the ruined habitats of the unemployed and impoverished climate refugees flooding her homeland.</Text>

                <Text>INTEGR’s aggressive platform of environmental reform and financial accountability was crucial to the dissolution of the Atlantic-Mediterranean-Euro-American Trade Agreement. Hailed by critics as the absolute manifestation of bad trade policy, the trade agreement was an easy target for the Responsible Party. INTEGR’s vocal minority opposition stood unified in the face of extreme external pressure. Lena Ebner’s leadership proved vital in the victory, lobbying a European parliamentary group for nearly 20 hours straight.</Text>

                <Text>Kavitha Thakur’s esoteric spiritual sutras and aphorisms have been interpreted by various theologians to have extremely diverse meanings. Some posit that her writings are ultimately Nāgārjunic in nature, and that her references to the Lord of the Cosmos, the Third Mother, and the Universal Divinity obscure the primacy of what she varying refers to as 'the Demon of Nihility' or simply 'the Void.' While Kavitha’s father supposedly received prophetic visions, it is surmised that Kavitha’s attempts to commune with the same spirit were met with what could only be described as a sinister nothingness.</Text>

                <Text>Kavitha’s complicated cosmology can be understood in many ways, however, there are two prevailing interpretations regarding her use of the ‘Third Mother.’ Both explanations agree that the ‘Third Mother’ references the planet that will be colonized during the Seeding. From there, however, theologians disagree on who, or what, constitutes the ‘First’ and ‘Second’ Mothers. One argument is that Old Earth, (a.k.a. ‘Gaia’ or ‘Terra’) is the First Mother, while the second is the literal mother of every individual. The other theory is that Kavitha refers to a supernatural progenitor as the First Mother, and that the Second Mother is humankind itself.</Text>

                <Text>Unlike the other Sponsors, the Kavithan Protectorate is primarily concerned with the spirituality of its colonists. This can easily be seen in the daily sermons Kavitha would deliver to the colonists chosen to populate the new planet, who she sometimes refers to as ‘Seedlings.’ During the preparation for the journey, she proselytized what she called ‘the Seeding’ of a new planet. The name for the mission gained popularity, and was adopted globally as an unofficial movement.</Text>

                <Text>Duncan Hughes is well regarded as one of the top sport fisherman in the world. Duncan’s largest catch, nicknamed the Aberdonian Monster, was a 95 kg mutant Atlantic Cod that, while too contaminated to eat, is still the largest cod caught on record. According to eyewitnesses, the fish was so large, Duncan was barely able to hold it for a photograph. He spent more than an hour reeling in the monster, and more than once feared he would be pulled overboard.</Text>

                <Text>Until the Seeding, Duncan Hughes’ proudest achievement was the development of the water-based, floating cities known as the ARKs. His experience as a longshoreman and naval engineer was instrumental in designing the concept, and it was his tireless commitment to the project that saw the first successful prototype go into production and eventual testing in the North Sea. The ARK program was an instant success, and revolutionized global trade.</Text>

                <Text>Duncan Hughes didn’t stop with the success of the ARK program. Although coming from a wealthy family, he never lost touch with the economically burdened majority in Scotland. He was known as a dedicated philanthropist and donated large sums to education and urban development. He was particularly supportive of children’s hospitals and orphanages that had been overextended as a result of climate refugees. The Hughes Institute in Aberdeen, a boarding school and public clinic, is just one of his many legacies.</Text>

                <Text>What brought Duncan Hughes international acclaim, and cemented his place in history, was his generosity. Some of the first beneficiaries of the ARKs were none other than the long-displaced climate refugees of the Maldive Islands. Hughes oversaw the entire project from its inception, and his guarantee that the ARKs would come at no cost to the people of the former islands was a landmark moment. Hughes personally went along for the delivery of the first ARK delivered from its port in Oslo to the Laccadive Sea. </Text>

Her theorem led to the eventual proving of Goldbach's conjecture, and for this work she was hailed as the most important mathematician in the history of the Pan-Asian Cooperative. She was awarded a special grant to continue her work, and received numerous accolades and honorary titles.

By dissecting the unique energy shortage crisis facing PAC, she was able to pinpoint the key component that was responsible for a majority of the shortfall in the Western Provinces. Rampant corruption had survived because of a lack of oversight, and by putting an end to specific criminal elements, the PAC not only made up the deficit, but increased overall production by nearly double. </Text>

                <Text>As a man of the people, Hutama would often disguise himself and spend time in public places to get to know his constituency. Besides loving his fellow Polystralians, Hutama wanted to understand their different viewpoints, especially on topics such as foreign relations and international trade. While this caused his Protective Service no end of problems, some speculate that it was one of these outings that caused him to reverse his position on the Seeding, and embrace extrasolar colonization.</Text>

As the eruption disrupted supply chains throughout Polystralia and displaced hundreds of thousands of Polystralians, the calamity was an unparalleled natural disaster, and rivalled the impact of the Great Mistake in terms of the effect on global food supplies. Hutama’s focus on the logistics of catastrophe mitigation combined with his understanding of the people resulted in the salvation of millions.</Text>

The results of the mission sent shockwaves throughout the world. While the Provenance Discovery had confirmed evidence of life, it was Kozlov’s team that found intact artifacts from presumably intelligent, extrasolar life. While much still remained a mystery, it was considered the most significant expedition of the century, and would have been impossible without Kozlov’s influence.</Text>

He likened the experience to “like the moon, but more red.” His yearlong traversal of Olympic Mons remains a record setting feat of endurance and effort, and it was his surveying of the Koval'skiy crater that allowed for the first Slavic Federation mining colony on Mars. It is with some pride that General Kozlov carries a Martian rock as a memento.</Text>

The text is used in all levels of education, and is the most frequently referenced literature in academic and political discourse.</Text>
