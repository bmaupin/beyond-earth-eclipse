This is a mod for Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth. The overall goal of the mod is to give the game more flavour.

Here are some instructions:

- Please remember this is a video game
- Use British spelling
- Beyond Earth is very similar to Civilization V, so sometimes code from Civ V will work
- Beyond Earth uses the Havok Script Lua engine
  - In particular, Havok Script adds types to Lua which aren't compatible with the Lua language server used by the vscode extension, so please remove types from Lua code
